🗑️ Garbage Classification AI
A 4-week undergraduate research project using CNN-based image classification to automatically classify waste into recyclable categories and improve sustainability awareness.

🔍 Motivation
As the world faces growing environmental concerns, efficient waste separation is becoming increasingly important. Manual recycling systems often suffer from human error and inconsistency. This project explores how deep learning can assist in automated garbage classification using image-based inputs, thereby supporting smarter waste management.

🎯 Objectives
* Classify garbage images into categories: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash
* Train and evaluate CNN-based models on real-world image data
* Improve model performance through data augmentation and transfer learning
* Visualize model predictions and attention areas using techniques like Grad-CAM
* (Optional) Explore lightweight models for potential mobile or web-based UI integration

📁 Dataset
* Garbage Classification Dataset – Kaggle
    * Classes: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash
